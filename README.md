## About the Project
My project is will focus on discovering possible lucrative advertisement placement opportunities in the US and
Mexico entertainment YouTube channels.  The data set can be downloaded on the website https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new. I used PostgreSQL to analyze, clean, and prepare the data to be uploaded to Tableau. I created an interactive dashboard which can be accessed here https://public.tableau.com/profile/christian.rios.chambi#!/vizhome/CRioschambiCapstone1YoutubeUS/USDASHBOARD?publish=yes
